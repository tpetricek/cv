* Cultures of Programming: The Development of Programming Concepts and Methodologies
  - authors: **Tomas Petricek**
  - year: 2025
  - venue: 420 pages, Cambridge Unviersity Press
  - type: monograph, interdisciplinary
  - isbn: 9781009492379
  - comment: The book documents important episodes from the history of programming, interprets them using a novel conceptual
       framework and provides programmers, computer scientists and historians of computing with a comprehensive account of
       the history of programming.
  - impact: The monograph develops a novel framework for understanding the development of concepts and methodo&shy;logies
      that programmers rely on in their work. It documents key episodes from the history of programming, interprets them
      in a new way and provides a rigorous basis for folklore notions such as hacker culture. The book compiles research
      conducted over the last 6 years, which already attracted interest, including an _invited industry keynote_ at _CodeMesh 2020_ and
      _invited talk_ at _Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic_ and _Meeting of the Pacific
      Division of the American Philosophical Association_ (ASL/APA) 2023.

  - impact: This recent paper, already with 16 citations (4 Scopus), makes explicit the distinction between programming languages
      and programming systems. It provides a conceptual framework for studying _programming systems_, addressing the need of an
      emerging research community. The framework has already been employed to describe novel programming systems developed by
      researchers in France, United Kingdom, United States and Germany.

  - gscholar: 131
  - wos: 39
  - scopus: 64
  - impact: This paper gives a wide-ranging development of _coeffects_, introduced a year before in a shorter paper by the authors.
      This longer paper appeared at the _CORE A_-rated ICFP conference and presents a unified and rigorous treatment of coeffects.
      It promulgated the idea of coeffects in the functional programming community and has 130+ citations (64 Scopus, 39 WoS) and
      influenced the design of _Scala_ and the _Hack_ language developed by Meta.
      The notion of coeffects has since been the topic of several grants in the UK, France, US, and Iceland. The associated
      interactive essay ([http://tomasp.net/coeffects](tomasp.net/coeffects)), which provides an accessible introduction to the work,
      received over 30k unique visits.

* The F# Computation Expression Zoo
  - authors: **Tomas Petricek** and Don Syme
  - venue: PADL 2014: Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages, vol. 8324, pp. 33-48

  - type: workshop
  - gscholar: 38
  - scopus: 13
  - impact: The paper presents a canonical description of _computation expressions_, an influential F# language feature developed earlier
      by the authors. F# computation expressions have been widely adopted by the industry for asynchronous and concurrent programming.
      The theoretical development in this paper directly inspired the design of corresponding langauge constructs in _C#_, _TypeScript_
      and mroe recently _JavaScript_. Although the main impact of this work is industrial, the paper also had impact on the programming
      language research community with 38 citations (13 Scopus) thanks to its novel unification of monadic abstractions.
