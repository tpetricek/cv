    <ul>
  
  
  
  <li>
    <p><strong>Assistant Professor, Charles University, Prague</strong>, 2022 – present</p>
    <p>I joined the <em>Department of Distributed and Dependable Systems</em> at Faculty of Mathematics
and Physics to pursue fundamental research on simple, open and trustworthy programming systems,
using theoretical, applied and interdisciplinary research methods.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  
  
  
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lecturer, University of Kent</strong>, 2018 – 2022</p>
    <p>As a member of the <em>Programming Languages and Systems</em> group, I worked on making programming
with data easy, trustworthy and accessible. I applied for grants from <em>EPSRC</em> (UK) and <em>ERC</em> (EU),
<em>Dstl &amp; GCHQ</em> (UK), taught graduate and undergraduate modules, supervised a PhD student and
initiated interdisciplinary collaboration with a colleagues from <em>Department of Philosophy</em>.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborating Fellow and Visiting Researcher, The Alan Turing Institute</strong>, 2016 – 2020</p>
    <p>I led a project <em>Programming Tools for Open Data Journalism</em> funded through <em>Google Digital News
Initiative</em>, joined the flagship ATI project <em>Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics</em> as a co-investigator
and obtained funding from <em>Dstl and GCHQ</em> for a follow-up project on semi-automated data wrangling.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  
  
  
  <li>
    <p><strong>Post-doctoral Researcher and Contractor, Microsoft Research Cambridge</strong>, 2014 – 2016</p>
    <p>I led the development of an open-source projects focused on doing data science with F#.
Resulting research was awarded a <em>Distinguished Paper</em> award and selected as an <em>SIGPLAN Research Highlight</em>.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Thesis <em>Context-aware Programming Languages</em> develops coeffects, a theory for tracking information about
environment in which programs are executed. I also devised a novel way of presenting the results in the form of
widely read interactive essay (<a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects">tomasp.net/coeffects</a>). Supervised by <em>Prof. Alan Mycroft</em>.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  
  
  
  <li>
    <p><strong>BSc and MSc, Computer Science, Charles University, Prague</strong>, 2004 – 2010</p>
    <p>MSc completed with distinction. Final thesis <em>Reactive Programming with Events</em>,
supervised by Dr Don Syme, developed abstractions for reactive and concurrent programming that were presented
in workshop papers.</p>
