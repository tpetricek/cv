    <h2>Professional Highlights</h2>
    <ol class="spacious">
      <li>
        <strong>International Experience.</strong>
        I obtained PhD from <em>University of Cambridge</em>, worked as post-doctoral researcher
        at <em>Microsoft Research</em> and in <em>The Alan Turing Institute</em> in London.
        I then spent 4 years as a lecturer (permanent academic position) at <em>University of Kent</em>.
        I collaborate with multiple research groups and my recent co-authors and research collaborators
        are based in the <em>UK</em>, <em>USA</em>, <em>Netherlands</em>, <em>Denmark</em>,
        <em>Germany</em> and <em>France</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Academic Publications.</strong>
          I am the author of 19 papers in top-tier venues (including <em>PLDI</em>,
          <em>POPL</em>, <em>ECOOP</em>, <em>ICFP</em> and <em>ICALP</em>), five of which received a best paper award and 26
          other papers. I wrote a monograph on history of programming (to be published by
          <em>Cambridge University Press</em>) and a tutorial book for professional developers
          (selling over 10,000 copies). I have an h-index of 14 (6 in WoS) and my work has 880+
          citations (160 in WoS).
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Research Impact.</strong>
      	 My PhD research, presented in a paper with 130+ citations (35 in WoS), introduced the notion
         of <em>coeffects</em> which has since been subject of several grants in the <em>UK</em>,
         <em>France</em>, <em>USA</em> and <em>Iceland</em>. It influenced the design of <em>Scala</em> and has been adopted by Meta
         in the <em>Hack</em> language. My research on functional programming also directly
         contributed to the design of the <em>F# language</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Peer Recognition.</strong>
        My paper on integration of external semi-structured data into a static
        type system, was awarded <em>Distinguished Paper Award</em> at PLDI and selected as
        <em>ACM SIGPLAN Research Highlight</em>, recognizing it as one of three best programming
        language papers of the year. I have been an invited <em>keynote speaker</em> at 5&nbsp;academic
        and industry conferences and joined the invitation-based
        <em>IFIP WG 2.16 Language Design</em> group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Technology Transfer.</strong>
        My work is not limited to papers. The open-source <em>F# Data package</em> I
        created is the most downloaded F# library and has over <em>110 industry contributors</em>.
        My work on asynchronous programming has become a core component of the infrastructure at
        Jet.com, a start-up acquired by Walmart for $3bn. The interactive web-based essays
        presenting my work, published at <a href="http://tomasp.net">tomasp.net</a>,
        have attracted <em>over 50,000 visitors</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Research Funding.</strong>
        I was awarded the 4-year <em>PRIMUS</em> grant at Charles University (worth €610,000) to
        establish a resarch group focused on <em>Types for data-centric programming</em>. Previously,
        I secured research funding (worth £420,000) from the UK Ministry of Defence (Dstl) and GCHQ for
        applied research on trustworthy and accessible tooling for data science
        and €50,000 from <em>Google Digital News Initiative</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Teaching Experience.</strong>
        I developed 2 new courses on <em>Programming Language Design and Implementation</em> at
        Charles University, redesigned the <em>Software Engineering</em> module at University of Kent
        and taught it to 40+ MSc and 200+ under&shy;graduate students. I taught or supervised
        labs for 9 other courses ranging from algorithms and formal semantics to human-computer interaction
        at Charles University, Kent and University of Cambridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Student and Research Supervision.</strong>
        I supervise <em>1 PhD student</em> and <em>2 post-docs</em> at Charles University. Previously,
        I supervised 1 PhD student at Unviersity of Kent (graduated in 2023),
        1 post-doc (now at University of Cambridge) and 4 graduate and undergraduate internships.
        At Charles University, I supervised
        <em>1 Bachelor's theses</em> (0 defended, 1 ongoing)
        and <em>0 Master's theses</em> (0 defended).
        At University of Kent, I supervised 40+ students for their final-year BSc and MSc projects
        and I supervised 3 final Part II projects at Cambridge.</li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Academic Service.</strong>
        I serve as the <em>General Chair</em> of the International Conference on the Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming
        2025 in Prague and have served as an organizer or co-chair of 5 other workshops and conference tracks.
        I have served as a <em>Program Committee</em> member of 43 conferences
        and workshops including <em>OOPSLA</em>, <em>ECOOP</em>, <em>HOPL</em>, <em>Programming</em> and <em>Onward!</em>
        I reviewed papers for 21 other journals and conferences, served
        as the examiner of <em>4 PhD theses</em> and reviewed 5
        international grant applications.
