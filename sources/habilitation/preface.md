Most of my research to date has been focused on the subject of programming languages and
systems. The topic can be studied from multiple perspectives and in multiple contexts and
my work explored multiple such research directions, each spanning multiple individual projects
and papers.

I studied the theory of (i) *context-aware programming* (in my PhD thesis), worked on (ii) *functional programming*
and the F# language (in parallel to my PhD studies), programming in the context of (iii) *data exploration*
(during my two Post-doctoral stays) and researched (iv) *interactive programming systems* (since joining
Univer&shy;sity of Kent). I also devoted a part of my time to (v) *interdisciplinary research*, focusing
on the history and philosophy of programming.

In each of those areas, my work has had (or is showing early signs of having) a lasting academic
and industrial impact. The presented annotated selection of the [five most important works](selected.html) serves as the
evidence for this fact. It includes five significant academic works, each representing one
of the five aforementioned research areas. The five selected works have been widely cited,
received significant academic awards, inspired international grant applications, influenced
main-stream programming languages or have been subject to invited keynotes.

My Habilitation dissertation _Simple programming tools for data exploration_ is centred on one
of the five research directions outlined above, choosing depth over breadth. It presents my work
on data exploration, which is an independent research direction that I pursued following my PhD and for
which I secured funding from multiple competitive sources. The research employed theoretical
programming language knowledge in the practical area of working with data. As such, the work
is of a more applied nature than some of my earlier research.

The dissertation provides a comprehensive summary of my work on data exploration, including
key theoretical publications, publications accompanying influential software
artifacts, as well as publications that complement the core theory with the practically necessary
applied developments. The aim of the dissertation is to show the work in context and highlight
connections that may not be apparent when reading individual papers. I also use the
longer format of a dissertation to highlight interesting work that has been perhaps less
widely recognized.

The key theoretical results in the dissertation rethink established programming language notions or
use them in a new way. These have been published in top conferences including CORE A*
(Chapters 6 and 13) and CORE A (Chapter 7), indexed journals (Chapters 11, 12) or received
best paper awards (Chapter 6 and 8). The theoretical results have been accompanied by multiple
open-source software packages, some of which have become widely adopted by industry.

The focus on the problem of data exploration in the dissertation serves not only to provide a
comprehensive overview of my recent work, but it also provides the background, and a fruitful
motivating example, for my current research direction.

The work presented in the dissertation views data exploration as a programming language problem
and uses a range of established programming language techniques to improve data science tools.
However, this perspective also raises new basic questions about programming language research
methodologies. It shows that we need to consider not only the languages, but also the stateful
interactive systems in which they are embedded. Generalizing from *programming languages* to
*programming systems* is an intriguing research direction that I intend to continue exploring
in the future.
