# Tomas Petricek's CV

I can no longer cope with maintaining of up-to-date academic CVs in the billions of possible required formats. Procrastinating with this instead! 
It turns the source data in `data` (written in machine readable Markdown) into various formats of CVs in `source` and generates nicely formatted CVs in `docs`.
